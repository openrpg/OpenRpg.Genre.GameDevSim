# Example App

This app contains 2 main things:

- The example data setup
- The example UI/Game

It is a bare bones example of how to use the library to create a simple game dev sim style game where you have a company with staff members and you are able to create games and have hem work on it.

> In the real world you would probably be using 2d/3d content but this console app will show the basics involved in getting stuff running, then you put whatever view layer on top of it that you want.

## How To Run It?

Just run it like you would do any other console app, it uses Spectre under the hood to do all the console stuff.
